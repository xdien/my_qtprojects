<center><h2> Description </h2></center>

 The image dataset is used by the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20070624011402/http://www.ri.cmu.edu/projects/project_320.html">CMU Face Detection 
Project</a> and is provided for evaluating algorithms for detecting frontal views of human faces.
This particular test set was originally assembled as part of work in
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20070624011402/http://www.ri.cmu.edu/projects/project_271.html">
Neural Network Based Face Detection</a>.  It combines images
collected at CMU and MIT.

<p></p>

<p>
Please give appropriate acknowledgements when you use these test sets.
In the lists of files below, you will find references to Test Sets A, B, C and
the Rotated Test Set.
Test Set B was provided by Kah-Kay Sung and
Tomaso Poggio at the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20070624011402/http://www.ai.mit.edu/projects/cbcl/web-homepage/web-homepage.html">AI/CBCL 
Lab at MIT</a>, and Test Sets A,C and the rotatated test set were collected 
here
at CMU (by <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20070624011402/http://www.ri.cmu.edu/people/rowley_henry_ext.html">Henry A. Rowley</a>, 
Shumeet Baluja, and <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20070624011402/http://www.ri.cmu.edu/people/kanade_takeo_ext.html">Takeo Kanade</a>).

[Schneiderman and Kanade, 1998]</a> we refer to the combination of test sets A,
B, and C as the "combined test sets of Sung and Poggio and Rowley, Baluja,
and Kanade."  In <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20070624011402/http://www.ri.cmu.edu/pubs/pub_2857.html">[Rowley, Baluja, and Kanade, 
1998]</a> we refer to the combination of sets A, B, C as
"test set one" and in <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20070624011402/http://www.ri.cmu.edu/pubs/pub_920.html">[Rowley, Baluja, and Kanade, 
1997]</a> we refer to it as the "upright set" as
distinguished from the "rotated set."

<center><h2> Additional Information </h2></center>

<p>
We provide
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20070624011402/http://vasc.ri.cmu.edu/idb/images/face/frontal_images/list.html"> 
ground truth in face location</a> in the following format with one line per 
face (extreme side views are ignored):
</p>
filename left-eye right-eye nose left-corner-mouth center-mouth 
right-corner-mouth<br>

<p>
For each feature on a face to be detected, two numbers are given. These 
numbers are the x and y coordinates (measured from the upper left corner) of
the feature in the image.

<p>
  The images are in
Compuserve GIF format, and are grayscale. The images are available  <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20070624011402/http://vasc.ri.cmu.edu/idb/images/face/frontal_images/images.html">individually</a> 
or <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20070624011402/http://vasc.ri.cmu.edu/idb/images/face/frontal_images/images.tar">collectively 
in a tar file</a>. This file will unpack into four directories, test
containing the images in Test Set A, test-low containing Test Set B, 
newtest containing Test Set C, and rotated containing the Rotated Test Set.
